NODE AND EXPRESS JS

NODE

1) Module 
fs -> The “file system” module with various functions to process data in the file system.
path -> Provides functions to process path strings.
util -> Provides various “utility” functions, such as util.promisify.

2) exec
var exec = require('child_process').exec,

EXPRESS

1) The express object -> express 
Top-level object. When the express() method is called it returns an
express application object. You need this application object to
make use of all other Express.js features.

2) The express app object -> app 
The app object is the most important object provided by the
Express framework. It has a number of useful methods:
• app.use
• app.get
• app.post
• app.delete
• app.put
• app.listen

->
1) The use method of the app object
app.use() 
The Express application will invoke the callback function without
regard to the path or method (POST or GET) of the incoming
request.
Basic syntax:
app.use(function(req,res,next){
//code goes here
});

2) The GET method of the app object -> app.get() 
Trap and manage an HTTP GET event.
The get() method takes a path as an argument, and also a callback
function. The callback function provides a request and a response
object.

The path can be ‘/’ which would mean no path.
The path can be ‘/xyz would trap an HTTP GET targeted at xyz. The
value ‘xyz’ is virtual. It does not correspond to a folder on the
servier’s file system.

Basic syntax:
app.get('/xyz',function(req,res){
//code goes here
});

3) The POST method of the app object -> app.post() 
Trap and manage an HTTP POST event. Similar to app.get.

4) The DELETE method of the app object ->app.delete() 
Trap and manage an HTTP DELETE event. Similar to app.get.

5) The PUT method of the app object -> app.put() 
Trap and manage an HTTP PUT event. Similar to app.get.

6) The listen method of the app object -> app.listen() 
This method defines the port that the express app object will listen
on. The callback function executes when the app has been started.
The method returns an object that summarizes the properties of
the server.
//here XXXX is the port number
app.listen(XXXX,function(){
});

7) The express request object -> req 
All of the app callback functions provide a request object. The
variable “req” is short for “request”. It represents the data sent to
the API endpoint. The Express framework (which includes bodyparser) improves and simplifies the request object provided by
Node.js alone.

The request object will have query and body child objects, which in
turn have properties that correspond to the data sent via GET and
POST.

For example:
req.query.x // refers to a query
// string parameter x
req.body.y // refers to a form tag
// with the name of y

8) The express response object -> res

The response object will have the following methods:
• header()
• writeHead()
• write()
• end()

9) The write method of the response object -> res.write() 
Write a stream of text to the HTTP response.

10) The end method of the response object -> res.end() 
End the HTTP response.

11) The express next object -> next() 
The app callback functions may also provide a next object. When
the next() method is called the next matching express app event
will be called.
