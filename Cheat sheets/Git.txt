GIT COMMANDS CHEAT SHEET

BASIC COMMANDS-

1) git init <directory>
Creates an empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository.

2) git clone <repo>
Clones repo located at <repo> onto local machine. Original repo can be
located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH.

3) git add <directory>
Stages all changes in <directory> for the next commit.
Replace <directory> with a <file> to change a specific file.

4) git status 
Lists which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked

5) git commit --amend / git commit -m "any message that defines the changes"
Replace the last commit with the staged changes and last commit
combined. Use with nothing staged to edit the last commit’s message.

BRANCH COMMANDS-

6) git branch 
Lists all of the branches in your repo. Add a <branch> argument to
create a new branch with the name <branch>.

7) git checkout -b <branch>
Create and check out a new branch named <branch>.
Drop the -b flag to checkout an existing branch.

8) git merge <branch> 
Merge <branch> into the current branch

REMOTE REPOSITORIES-

9) git remote add <name> <url>
Creates a new connection to a remote repo. After adding a remote,
you can use <name> as a shortcut for <url> in other commands.

10) git pull <remote> 
Fetch the specified remote’s copy of current branch and
immediately merge it into the local copy.

11) git push <remote> <branch>
Push the branch to <remote>, along with necessary commits and
objects. Creates named branch in the remote repo if it doesn’t exist.

GIT PULL -

12) git pull --rebase <remote>
Fetch the remote’s copy of current branch and rebases it into the local
copy. Uses git rebase instead of merge to integrate the branches.

GIT PUSH -

13) git push <remote>--force
Forces the git push even if it results in a non-fast-forward merge. Do not use
the --force flag unless you’re absolutely sure you know what you’re doing.

14) git push <remote> --all 
Push all of your local branches to the specified remote.

15) git push <remote> --tags
Tags aren’t automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the
--all flag. The --tags flag sends all of your local tags to the remote repo.
